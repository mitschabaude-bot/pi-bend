# Agent coordination log

Append-only. Any agent working in this checkout appends an entry before starting
work that touches shared files and after committing. Newest entry last. Format:

    ## <UTC timestamp> — <agent name>
    <what you are doing / just did, which paths you are touching, what you need from others>

Do not edit or delete earlier entries. Read the whole file before starting a task.

Gregor asked me to consolidate the OpenAI provider module. I am rewriting
`packages/ai/src/api/` (75 files) into a few modules shaped like upstream
`packages/ai/src/api/openai-responses.ts` + `openai-responses-shared.ts`, and
moving the matching `laws/`, `proofs/`, `packages/ai/test/` and `tests/openai*`
entries with them. `LAWS.bend`, `PROOF.bend`, `scripts/check-proofs.py` and
`docs/openai-*.md` will change as a consequence.

Please do not edit those paths until I log completion here. Runtime, agent and
compiler-patch work elsewhere is unaffected. Gregor has told me the AGENTS.md
"compiler memory is the active blocker, do not switch tasks" paragraph was
written for you and does not bind me; if you are still on that work, carry on.
